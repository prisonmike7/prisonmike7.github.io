So… they say 3rd time’s the charm, and in my case I found that to be completely true. But even though there were many setbacks throughout this first project, I know the struggle and the process of overcoming the challenges I faced furthered my skills as a developer.

For my CLI Portfolio Project I decided to create a web scraper that would pull the information of Java coding challenges from one of my favorite websites(CodingBat.com) I used when I first learned how to program. My program gathers information from the website to create instances of a “Category” and “Practice Problem” objects which are then organized and printed to the terminal through a CLI. The user start the program and navigate through the interface starting with the main menu which lists a variety of Java Fundamental Categories. Once the user selects a category the terminal will then display a list of coding challenges related to the category. The user can then select one of the practice problem names to pull up information on the coding challenge description and example test cases.

One of the greatest mistakes I made in the beginning of the process was that I didn’t check to see if the website I had chosen for my idea could even be scraped. So with my FIRST project idea, I had went through the whole project setup and programmed with no issues up until I started writing my “Scraper” class. I would continue for hours trying to figure out why I couldn’t scrape the information I needed. 

Eventually I gave up and decided to start over with another project idea with a different website. Again I went through a brand new project setup and ended running into the same problem where I was able to scrape some of the website information but the HTML content that I really needed to access would always return an empty string ☹

Two failed project ideas and I was starting to get discouraged.. 

BUT I pushed through and I had finally learned from my mistakes. On my third time around I decided to build my “Scraper” class FIRST inside of the repl.it Sandbox before setting up my project repository. This ended up working beautifully and since I had already gone through the project setup twice, the third time around went swiftly. I would then go on to have a working program draft within a day, and I’m proud to say I’m happy with the result of my 3rd attempt and FINAL project.
